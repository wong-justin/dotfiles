# --- PANE MANAGEMENT --- #

# ideally, use a tiling window manager with these keybinds,
# and create new terminal gui instances instead of new tmux windows,
# and resize terminal guis instead of resizing terminal panes, etc

# create new panes, explained:
#  - bind -n <keypress> means bind to root table of naked, non-prefixed keybinds, I think
#  - split-window -h means spawn a pane right, and -v means spawn a pane below
#  - -b means reversed direction, like -vb means up instead of down
#  - -c <cwd> means start that pane with parent <cwd>
bind -n C-Right split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -n C-Down split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -n C-Left split-window -hb -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -n C-Up split-window -vb -c '#{pane_current_path}'

# close pane
bind -n C-S-W kill-pane -t:

# move between panes with alt-vimkeys (M- means Meta/Alt)
# note: select-pane will wrap around screen edge, 
#   ie. select-pane -L from leftmost pane will move to rightmost pane
bind -n M-h select-pane -L
bind -n M-j select-pane -D
bind -n M-k select-pane -U
bind -n M-l select-pane -R

# resize panes
bind -n M-S-Left resize-pane -L
bind -n M-S-Right resize-pane -R
bind -n M-S-Down resize-pane -D
bind -n M-S-Up resize-pane -U

# new-window ~= new tab
# next-window ~- next tab
# note: I think alacritty is gobbling my C-Tab inputs.. or doesn't regonize them
bind -n C-Tab next-window
bind -n C-S-t new-window

# TODO: a shortcut for swap-pane (with last selected pane, ideally)
# TODO: a shortcut for ctrl+tab = next-window, and maybe ctrl+shift+t = new-window
# TODO: a shorcut for ctrl+shift+w = kill-pane, and maybe ctrl+w = kill-window



# --- OTHER --- #

# 1-based indexing feels better, supposedly
set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# fix ESC delay for vim
set -g escape-time 10

# choose comfy leader key / prefix
# note that C-Space may be capture by terminal emulator
# set -g prefix C-Space
# set C-Space send-prefix
# 
# EDIT - yep, alacritty does not let me use C-Space
#        so im just using naked, non-prefixed keybinds now
