todo

- pip and npm and any other common packages with global (dev) packages installed - copy those lists of packages

- find a way to copy fish functions; maybe just the whole dir?

- sncli

- i think storing histories falls under the duty of this dotfiles repo;
it's part of porting over environment functionality from one machine to another

  * careful to avoid revealing personal secrets tho

non-cli tools?
- browser(s) config (+ histories) (+ bookmarks?)
maybe acocunt-based cloud sync is better for these bigger mainstream gui desktop tools
and that starts to become the whole state of the system, not just the config
