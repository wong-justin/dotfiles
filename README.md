todo

- find a way to copy fish functions; maybe just the whole dir?

- i think storing histories falls under the duty of this dotfiles repo;
it's part of porting over environment functionality from one machine to another

  * careful to avoid revealing personal secrets tho

  * EDIT - nvm, history is state, kinda like browser history, and it's somewhat specific to the machine, and it's different than config

non-cli tools?
- browser(s) config (+ histories) (+ bookmarks?)
maybe acocunt-based cloud sync is better for these bigger mainstream gui desktop tools
and that starts to become the whole state of the system, not just the config
